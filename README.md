# password-generator
This is a homework assignment I completed for the Coding Boot Camp at UC Irvine. The task was to write a function that would generate a password to certain specifications (provided by the user), and display that password to the screen.

Uses Bootstrap for styling.

Update to do list:
1. Add a button to copy the password directly to the clipboard
